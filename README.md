# About this .py code creation
To start with, I want to sincerely apologize for one thing regarding my first project pushed to GitHub: most of its initial version was completed with AI assistance.  

As a developer from China, some parts of the code include Chinese descriptions—if these are hard to understand, feel free to use a translator, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  

Since pushing it, I’ve been working to take over the development independently: **one-fifth of the project is now completed by my own work** (no AI help). Most importantly, I’m committed to gradually rewriting and finishing the entire project on my own when I have more time, and I’ll update the repository regularly to show progress.  

This is my first time building a full project independently, so I’d be incredibly grateful for any guidance you can offer—whether it’s pointing out bugs, suggesting optimizations (like better code structure or logic), or sharing best practices for open-source projects.  

Also, to clarify: this project is licensed under the MIT License. You’re welcome to use, modify, or distribute it in line with the MIT terms—no additional restrictions apply.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for any help you might provide!
